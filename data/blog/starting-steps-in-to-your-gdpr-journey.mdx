Getting starting on creating and implementing your GDPR policy in your company can be overwhleming, yet if done early can be made cost efficient in the long term.

Getting a grasp of implementating your GDPR obligations ealier could save you a fortune down the road. Our platform offers a simple checklist that you can follow to get started:

#Map information assets#
Mapping all the company's information assets, e.g. IT systems, folders with personal data, PCs, mobile phones, and other things that can store and process personal data is the first and important step to ensure you miss anything out that would be captured by the regulation.

You must use this overview to ensure that the company has appropriate measures for compliance with the GDPR regulations. It is often in the IT systems that our processing of personal data is carried out, so it is in these that we must comply with the rules in practice.

#Obtain agreements with data processors:#
You will need to make sure you have data processing agreements with all your data processors.

#Create your company's statutory register:#
Start by describing your company's processes where personal data is processed.

Examples of processes in your company?

Sales and delivery of services to customers.
Marketing: For example, Facebook, outreach, the website.
HR: Payroll, mouse, recruitment, employment, dismissal.
Finance: Invoicing, bookkeeping.
Communication? Mail, Facebook, Linkedin, phone, website, and whatever else you could have in your business.

For each process, you must describe the content, as described in Article 30 of the Data Protection Regulation.

#Make a risk assessment:#
Make a risk assessment of your processing of personal data.

You must use the risk assessment to assess how 'hard' your company must implement the GDPR rules. It is therefore important to prioritize this, and it can therefore also save you time in the long run.

#Comply with the requirements for privacy by default and privacy by design:#
Ensure that your company complies with the requirement for privacy by default in the company's systems and processes.

Whenever possible, you must also comply with the requirement for privacy by design.

#Ensure that employees process personal data correctly:#
Make guidelines for employees' processing of personal data , e.g. use of IT tools, and ensure that employees follow your guidelines.

If your employees do not comply with good GDPR practices, then your company does not comply with the GDPR rules. Therefore, it is central that you work to ensure that your employees have knowledge of the GDPR rules , as well as your company's practices.

#Review the IT security in your company and follow up with necessary changes.#

#Get control of physical security:#
Review the company's physical security, e.g. block access to the server, clean up papers, and consider whether you should introduce relevant security measures in your company.

#Communicate to your customers:#
Inform your customers about how you use their personal data - including name, email and phone number!

It is obvious to draw up a personal data policy, which you upload on your website. It enables you to send an email with a link to customers and business partners as needed.

#Communicate to your employees:#
Inform your employees about how you use their personal data.

You start collecting personal data about your employees during the recruitment phase. Therefore, you must already inform job applicants about your processing of their personal data. Here it is obvious to have a personal data policy on the website, where they describe how you process their information.

When you have found the person you want for the job, you must process personal data in employment relationships, e.g.
