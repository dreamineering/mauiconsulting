The Danish Data Protection Agency (Datatilsynet) has been reported Danske Bank to the police and fined it 10 million Danish kroner (NZD $2.1 million) for violations of the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

Over a investigation begining November 2020, Datatilsynet had said that Danske Bank had not been able to present proper processing procedures for deleting and storing personal data. This is in more than 400 systems that hold millions of people’s data. The Danish Bank had clearly stated, in its apporach to meeting obligations, the volume of work to be done would have been best achieved in a phased approach - comepleted by 2021.

Datatilsynet identifed the lack of a group-wide information records management framework, not limited to but also limited data governance back in 2018 and raised concerns internally highlighting the associated risks of being noncompliant with the GDPR. 

This will be a precedent set by Datatilsynet for dealing with future cases in Denmark, but as a stark deterrance for all businesses in Denmark also.
