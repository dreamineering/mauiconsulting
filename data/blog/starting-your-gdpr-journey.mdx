Getting starting on creating and implementing your GDPR policy in your company can be overwhleming, yet if done early can be made cost efficient in the long term.

Getting a grasp of implementating your GDPR obligations ealier could save you a fortune down the road. Our platform offers a simple checklist that you can follow to get started:

Map information assets:
This should be the very first step, mapping all the company's information assets, e.g. IT systems, folders with personal data, PCs, mobile phones, and other things that can store and process personal data to ensure you don't miss anything out that would be captured by the regulation.

This is a crucial overview to ensure that the company has appropriate measures for compliance with the GDPR regulations. There are many ways to conduct this activity, dependent on the make up and size of your organisation. Being thorough in this step, makes conducting the risk assesmentless stressful.

Obtain agreements with data processors:
This step is definitely important, often you will have this process done when purchasing other products that your company will use capture personal data.  You will need to make sure that you have data processing agreements with all your data processors. But this will be a goodtime to review the standard you hold your agreements to, knowning your position when breaches are made and how liabilities can affect your business.

Create your company's statutory register:
Start by describing your company's processes where personal data is processed. Some examples of processes in your company:

Sales and delivery of services to customers.
Marketing: For example, Facebook, outreach, the website.
HR: Payroll, mouse, recruitment, employment, dismissal.
Finance: Invoicing and other bookkeeping.
Communication: Mail, Facebook, Linkedin, phone, website, and whatever else you could have in your business.

For each process, you must describe the reasons for capturing the content, as described in Article 30 of the Data Protection Regulation.

Make a risk assessment:
The risk assessment is a crucial step in ensuring not just good data compliance, but will set the company direct in the long term. Making a risk assessment of your processing of personal data, though daunting and time consuming, it is actually a good start to tidy your digital workplace.

Good use of the risk assessment helps assess how 'hard' your company must implement the GDPR rules. It is therefore important to prioritize this, and it can therefore also save you time in the long run.

Comply with the requirements for privacy by default and privacy by design:
Ensure that your company complies with the requirement for privacy by default in the company's systems and processes.

Whenever possible, you must also comply with the requirement for privacy by design.

Ensure that employees process personal data correctly:
Make guidelines for employees' processing of personal data , e.g. use of IT tools, and ensure that employees follow your guidelines.

If your employees do not comply with good GDPR practices, then your company does not comply with the GDPR rules. Therefore, it is central that you work to ensure that your employees have knowledge of the GDPR rules , as well as your company's practices.

Review IT security in your company and follow through with necessary changes.

Get control of physical security:
It goes without saying, reviewing the company's physical security, e.g. block access to the server, clean up papers, and considering where you should introduce relevant security measures in your company boost confidence in those whose data you capture and or process that much higher.

Communicate to your customers:
This is where privacy policie are crucial in the strong privacy edifice of your company. Informing your customers about how you use their personal data - including name, email and phone number ensures them transparency and strong brand built on trust.

Ensure your personal data policies, are discoverable whether it be on your website or other platforms. 

Communicate to your employees:
Informing your employees about how you use their personal data is not something taken lightly, for mistakes can and do happened within the operational arm of big companies.

Collecting personal data about your employees often starts during the recruitment phase. Therefore, you must already inform job applicants about your processing of their personal data. Here it is obvious to have a personal data policy on the website, where they describe how you process their information. Followed by the information captured in employment contracts, but due process do not end here and continue well in to the offboarding stages.
