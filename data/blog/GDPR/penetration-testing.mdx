summary: 'The Principles of Penetration Testing'

The idea of data protection alone has not been solely the security of data held, yet, when keeping an close on detail, testing of security systems that touch personal data is an expectation as enshrined in article 32 of the GDPR. Article 32 states:“(d) a process for regularly testing, assessing and evaluating the effectiveness of technical and organizational measures for ensuring the security of the processing."   

The article introduces the idea of penetration testing, the idea though of this article is, vague on what specifically must be tested and what is considered regular. The article also doesn't give reason to understand why penetration testing is an important security factor of GDPR, however, the mandatory breach disclosure assumedly does give enough of an incentive to do so. In addition, the GDPR stresses the importance of a ‘privacy-by-design’ model to your companies or organisations' way of handling personal data. Whether threats to security are attributed to cyber criminals seeking vulnerabilities to exploit, or those SaaS platforms & web applications are being developed, protecting personal data ought to be complex and privacy and security must be at the front of your mind. 

When compromising or overlooking security in exchange for sooner release dates, can lead to holes in your security and eventual breaches. On-going penetration testing & security assessments of applications help in reinforcing your model of ensuring privacy-by-design, and is an effective way of assessing your technical defences. It's key to show your clients and stakeholders there are no weak spots in your businesses infrastructure, so they know their data is safe.

We must not confuse however, that a penetration test is different from a vulnerability test, and the penetration seeks to determine different results. A penetration test are common conduct in five steps:

1. Finding a vulnerability;
2. Design an attack;
3. Appoint team of ethical hackers;
4. Determine what kind of data that could be taken;
5. Act on the findings.

Penetration testing being a controlled form of ethical hacking. One of the major benefits of penetration testing is that it gives you an insight into your organisation that’s not possible through internal audits or risk assessments. Penetration tests are an excellent tool that can be used to detect weaknesses in web servers, web browsers, email clients, point-of-sale software, operating systems, server interfaces, even including human weaknesses and as such, form an essential part of your GDPR compliance practices. 

When identifying problems during development
For many organisations, penetration tests are commonly conducted when they’re building a new system to identify risks that could be overlooked. Testing at an early stage, enables you to have a greater flexibility of correcting weaknesses and avoid the risk of going live with a system or software, only to be easily exploited.

Such testing also helps demonstrate what other various weaknesses that can be used alongside other issues in which can cause greater damage. Becoming proactive and understanding of flaws in a system serves a dual purpose of keeping security sealed tight and raising the trust in your brand. Because it is safe to say, there is no such thing as an impervious system, even if small vulnerabilities may appear insignificant, without robust checks can allow testers and hackers to create intrusion sequences, with small and steady efforts, can pry open security gaps into much greater weaknesses. 

Post-test checks?
At the conclusion of a penetration test, an end-of-state check is completed as the final part of the process that ensures the necessary security controls are implemented, as it gives an accurate idea of the final product developed. Any report produced can outline their, which is preferred over automatically generated reports, where details can be provided and give greater clarity of needed remediation, where automated tools could be limited to generic and ill-fitted recommendations. As such, organisation the ability to prioritise the biggest risks and address them accordingly as a step towards achieving GDPR compliance.
