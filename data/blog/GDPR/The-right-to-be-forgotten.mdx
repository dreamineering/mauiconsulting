Data Deletion and the Right to be forgotten

A fundamental element to the principles of privacy, is the right to exercise control over one's life, especially one that leaves a digital footprint. The right to be forgotten, a powerful element - can limit the power of government of prolonged overreach, which of course comes within reason.

When it comes to the GDPR, article 17 enshrines the right of individuals to be forgotten and oblige data controllers to delete personal data “without undue delay” within reason. Such reasons exist when it is, ‘no longer necessary to retain the personal data, consent is legitimately withdrawn; that there is an objection to processing, and that there is also no overriding legitimate grounds for processing; and grounds of unlawfully processing.’

Of course limits to this right exist for grounds of accountability on part of the controller, ranging from:
The personal data your company/organisation is holding needs to exercise the right of freedom of expression;
That there is a legal obligation to keep that data; and
For reasons of public interest (for example public health, scientific, statistical or historical research purposes).

In the world of data collection, the issue of deletion is faced with ever evolving conflict. Where, for instance, data custody could have more than one controller, If sensitive data is for some reason unintentionally captured. Iif the data subject is deceased and cannot represent oneself, if issues of data retention conflict with free expression, and issues of legislation.

The GDPR in this regard offers a process approach solution, putting policy to practice, what must be eliminated before the process begins, establishing what exclusions are there from the rules of this right. Random requests, on the face of it, would not appear to be subject to these deletion rules, which are distinguished from unsubscriptions and the like. The request must however, fall into one of these five situations:

First, is the purpose. If the purpose has the expiring date such as the retention period is over, then that data no longer serves its original purpose and can be deleted. Employment can reveal a variety of examples here.

Second, is consent. If the original data collection was based on a voluntary agreement, then the data subject has the right to revoke that agreement at any time and request deletion. 

Third, is objection. An organization is collecting data and the data subject contests it, if the collecting organization cannot provide a prevailing reason to continue processing that data, then the subject can require the controller to erase it. 

Four, and it goes without saying, if the processing is not done legally. Therefore, it must be erased. 
Five, if the controller is subject to laws that require data to be erased, then they must comply with the EU member's state laws. Understanding the situations that require controllers to erase personal data is important to the overarching data subject rights. When observing this right according to the laws of non-EU countries, a variety of the above steps naturally apply. 

The threshold can be somewhat lower, and the bar often starts at the questions of necessity. Charging for this service does exist for countries outside the EU, within reasonable ground. Retention may involve the public interest, such as the laws regarding tax deems retention necessary.
