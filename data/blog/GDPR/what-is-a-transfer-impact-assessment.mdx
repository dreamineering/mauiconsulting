What are Transfer Impact Assessments?
The creation of personal data Transfer Impact assessments are the result of the judgement resulting out of the Schrems II case in the Court of Justice of the EU (CJEU). Invalidating the decision from the European Commission’s 2016, known as decision 2016/1250, that the Privacy Shield was adequate to enable data transfers under EU law to the United States. The obligations to perform these impact assessments are laid out clause 12 of the newer standard contractual clauses (SCCs). SCCs, which are also issued by the European Commission, require immediate implementation prior to transfer of personal data from the EU level to any third party country. Where a transfer of personal data out of the EU to a third party country is requested, but lacks the sufficient protections offered within the EU, such company is then required to comply with the mechanism adopted by the commission, that is specified in the GDPR. 

There are of course categories of considered third party countries, such as:- (i) a country that benefit of an adequacy decision by the European Commission, and guarantees adequate protection of personal data; and (ii) third countries that are not subject to such an adequacy decision, (which include the United States), in which case the implementation of further safeguards are required. Adequacy decisions may just be specific to a particular territory or organisation.

Impact assessments, which are conducted by a data controller or processor, analyses the impact of security implications of a country outside the EU, that is not benefited by the adequacy findings of the European Commission. Impact assessments take the form of a questionnaire, depending on how it is conducted, has to be done for every personal data processing activity. It establishes whether the laws of the third party country allow for government agency access, but also looks into other factors of consideration, such as the level of protection of human rights.

What are the steps in a safe and secure TIA?
The general principles of transfer of personal data stresses a “level of protection”, the test set out in article 45.2. What is important is to ensure that a thorough analysis of the applicable legal framework of the third country is carried out. Understanding all the risks, real or hypothetical, that could threaten the security of the personal data you wish to transfer outside the EEA.

The EDPB proposes a five-step measure that supplements transfer tools to ensure compliance with the EU regulation:

1. Conduct data mapping of all personal data; knowing your transfers and where they're going to and the purpose for which is being transferred to ensure security wherever it is being processed;

2. The tools used meet the requirements under Chapter V of the GDPR, especially the adequate safeguards under article 46 of the regulation;

3. Assess if there is anything in the law and/or practices in force of the third country that may impinge on the effectiveness of the appropriate safeguards of the transfer tools you are relying on, in the context of your specific transfer. You should ensure the guarantees on the level of protection of the importing country are equivalent under the protections guaranteed in the GDPR, that includes access to public authorities, the rights and remedies of data subjects;

4. Identify and adopt supplementary measures that are necessary to bring the level of protection of the data transferred up to the EU standard of essential equivalence. Such examples of non-exhaustive list are:
 (i) Anonymisation and or pseudonymisation of personal data;
 (ii) Access security like encryption;
 (iii) Any other forms practised;

6. Take any formal procedural steps the adoption of your supplementary measure may require, depending on the Article 46 GDPR transfer tool you are relying on;

7. Re-evaluate at appropriate intervals the level of protection afforded to the personal data you transfer to third countries and to monitor if there have been or there will be any Adopted 5 developments that may affect it. The principle of accountability requires continuous vigilance of the level of protection of personal data. 

The implementation of the TIA  process is indeed meticulous, that is helpful with knowledge and understanding of a legal framework that governs personal data. This is true where such a structure must be in existence both at the European level and at the third party country of which imports the data. With an added support of legal guidance will allow smooth implementation and transfer security.
