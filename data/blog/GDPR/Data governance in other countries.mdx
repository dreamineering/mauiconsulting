Data Governance in other countries - the comparison

Part 1 - New Zealand: Privacy Act 2020

Enacted: December 1, 2020
The legislation applies to all businesses dealing with data of New Zealand residents, even if they’re not physically present in the country. It also defines that almost every person or organisation that holds personal information is according to the law an “agency”. That means government departments, companies as well as religious groups, schools and clubs.

What is the definition of personal data?
Personal data or “Personal information” is any information that identifies a living individual. The list includes: 
Name 
* Email addresses
* IP addresses
* Biometric data
* Unique IDs 
* Purchase and online shopping history
* Search and browser history
* Data about the device, operating system, updates, etc.
* Settings and website preferences
* Location data
* Behavioural data - This could suggest that marketing tools operating on unique identifiers, and including cookies are affected by the legislation.

Key obligations 
* Businesses must inform individuals about their collected data. This includes the need to notify and inform about data collection, the use and sharing of their personal data. The way notification is done is not limited.
* Be informed of individuals’ rights. Under the New Zealand legislation, much of the rights of individuals replicate that afforded in the GDPR, such as the right to access and rectify data companies collect about them.
* Notify who must know about data breaches. In a breach of a persons privacy expectations, the Act clearly states that the agency must notify both the affected individual and the privacy commissioner.
Know your rules on cross-border data transfers. The Act prohibits disclosing personal information overseas. The exception to the rule if the agency can verify that the recipient agency:
  a. Is subject to comparable safeguards to those that apply under the New Zealand legislation, and agrees to such safeguards; or
  b. There is a expressly consent to the disclosure of the data transfer, even though the data subject is informed that the recipient state may lack comparable safeguards to those under the New Zealand Act.
 
NZ Law and the GDPR 
The intent of New Zealand aims to regulate the flow of information about users between countries and companies, though it may require much more interpretation as to the strength of the components of the Act. It may even be argued that it lacks the strength of GDPR and other modern privacy laws. It is interesting to note, that it doesn’t establish a framework that would give data subjects the ability to opt in or out of tracking their data. It also doesn’t afford the right to be forgotten or the right to data portability. The privacy commissioner does not have the ability to hand out fines for privacy breaches, as opposed to the rights afforded to the agencies under the GDPR or the CCPA.

Penalties
The Act does have criminal offences however of fines of up to NZD10,000 where:
- Make or give any false or misleading statements
- Falsely represent that a person has authority under the Privacy Act
- Impersonate or falsely pretend to be an individual for the purposes of obtaining access to an individual’s personal information 
- Knowingly destroy documents containing personal information that is the subject of a request
